<!--excerpt-->
_Small Engine Maintenance and Repair_ is a short film dealing with the futility of human artifice, the nature of self-destructive behaviour, and and the inevitability of death â€“ with tongue placed firmly in cheek.

Special thanks to Ian Thomas and Byron Rich for their appearances; and Emma Sonder and Gene Frank, who poured their sweat, tears, and in one case, actual blood into this film.
