*Objects Recovered From Site D* is a short electronic book.  All of the objects appearing in the book were recovered by the artist during her expeditions to Site D in September of 2015.
<!--excerpt-->
The book presents many unsolved mysteries that curious readers could, perhaps, find answers to. Consult your pineal gland.

A very special thank you to René Descartes, who graciously allowed his work to be used in *Objects Recovered From Site D*. Thanks, René!
