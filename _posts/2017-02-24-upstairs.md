For Art-Partment 2017, I collaborated with Dave Ambroso to create _Upstairs_, an interactive installation.

_Upstairs_ uses interactive elements, light, and sound to transform commonplace objects and spaces into a surreal experience. As an individual moves throughout the space in which the piece is installed, objects in the room sense and react to their presence.

I constructed the interactive elements of _Upstairs_, using Arduino and a number of infra-red distance sensors to detect the viewer's position. Dave Ambroso designed the layout of the installation. At the opening, Dave and Michael Ross performed musical improvisations inside the installation.
