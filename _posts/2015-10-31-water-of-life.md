<p class="lead">Water is life: all Earthly organisms rely on water. Water is death: it drowns, floods, washes away.</p>

Water is life: even the purest water teems with untold millions of invisible micro√∂rganisms, many of which are necessary to human survival. Water is death: just as many of these organisms are deadly.</p>

These dualities, and the vital part water plays in our lives, mean that water holds religious or mystical significance in almost every culture, and its starring role in the natural make it equally significant in science, medicine, and engineering.

<em>Water of Life</em> is a kinetic mixed media sculpture incorporating living organisms. A diaphragm pump circulates water containing <em>Pyrocystis fusiformis</em>, a species of marine dinoflagellate which, under the correct conditions, produces a blue bioluminescent glow. Through the combination of recycled materials, scientific apparatus, occult symbols, and living beings, <em>Water of Life</em> evokes a series of dualities: between life and death, science and mysticism, form and function.
